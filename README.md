# node-react-graphQL

Here a simple boilerplate to have a node app hooked with create-react-app ( using proxy for dev ) that use graphQL

**SETUP**

`npm run setup`

**RUN**

`npm run dev` will launch create-react-app web server and nodemon on the app. 
`npm run prod` will create a build and launch a local server to test
`npm start` is being used by elastic, but is similar to prod, just using node instead of nodemon.
